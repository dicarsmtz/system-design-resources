- **Company engineering blogs** (Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook)
- **System Design Roadmap** ([roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/system-design))

### Hands-On Practice
- Design and implement distributed systems projects
- Contribute to open-source distributed systems
- Practice system design interviews regularly
- Build monitoring and observability into your projects
- Experiment with different database technologies and messaging systems

Remember: The key to mastering system design is combining theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Build systems, break them, fix them, and scale them. Each book provides a different lens on the same fundamental problems of building reliable, scalable, and maintainable distributed systems.
